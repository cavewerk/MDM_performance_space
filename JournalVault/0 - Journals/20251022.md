# Premeditations

oops, been a way for a while. but lots of new stuff to think about:
- [[prototypes]]
- [[sketching]]
- [[texture]]
let's start with texture what is texture? how does texture emerge? its tied to scale and frame. it can emerge from any realm in the [[unified-time-structuring]], but some vantage points are definitely easier to access than others. a textural piece is one that hold the listeners awareness in the liminal space between systems of organization, form>rhythm>pitch>timbre. we can come back to prototypes and sketching.

lets get that impulse generator going.

Software sketching, we need to build these software jigs. This is sorely lacking and should be priority no. 1.
