# Premeditations

I am still waiting on my cable but i should start conceptualizing what can be done with it. Do some sketching... Maybe some kind of granular synth where I can capture a phrase on the guitar polyphonically and then explore the phrase through some embodied gesture. That could be interesting.

But this is just one module right? What can we make right now? Some kind of [[impulse synth]]? That could be cool, lets start with that. And let's get our subpatching/abstractions together (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RznNyQzhw&t=1013s)
