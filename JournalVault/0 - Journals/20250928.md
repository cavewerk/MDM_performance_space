# premeditations

Still waiting on breakout cable, but want to start. Shifting focus away from secondary goals towards primary intention, performing asap. Need to link sketches to this vault. Should I pay for obsidian sync??!! :( i really dont want to pay for more stuff. wtv. So first project, let's do that morphing sequencer. Regressor model mapped to step sequencer, ryoji ikeda type sounds. ipad touch screen? i think this is a weekend project. and that was the plan right? [[the goal is weekend projects]], that's the only way to get it done.

# commit

Init first module. Import basic flucoma regressor patch (2d to 8d). Should regressor patch be separate from sequencer? Probably, may discretize into seperate modules in future.
