# premeditations

Still waiting on breakout cable, but want to start. Shifting focus away from secondary goals towards primary intention, performing asap. Need to link sketches to this vault. Should I pay for obsidian sync??!! :( i really dont want to pay for more stuff. wtv. So first project, let's do that morphing sequencer. Regressor model mapped to step sequencer, ryoji ikeda type sounds. ipad touch screen? i think this is a weekend project. and that was the plan right? [[the goal is weekend projects]], that's the only way to get it done.

mark fell: an album made in max is like some kind of business card

# commit

Init first module. Import basic flucoma regressor patch (2d to 8d). Should regressor patch be separate from sequencer? Probably, may discretize into separate modules in future.

# reflections

what about a [[relay synth]]? what are the parameters we want to sequence? amplitude? or should that just be binary? or should we have triggers and amplitude? triggers, amplitude, probability, send. are we just recreating the opal synth? would that be an issue, not really. while we're at it, why not port the lyra-8 over to max. and what about quad? we're not making a business card.
